Making the unikernel layer as reliable as possible is mandatory because it controls the linked application's execution. However, like commodity OS kernels, the unikernel suffers from software bugs and non-deterministic hardware failures. The current standard for recovering a failed unikernel is reboot-based and it involves restarting the whole unikernel-linked application, which leads to service stops and long downtimes. This paper presents VampOS that performs efficient reboot-based recovery of the unikernel layer. VampOS forces the unikernel components to interact with each other in a message-passing manner to restart only the damaged one while keeping the others and the application running. We prototyped VampOS on Unikraft 0.8.0 and QEMU 6.1.50. The experimental results show that the prototypes for four applications effectively recover the failed components with almost zero downtime.",

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale differential analysis of the correctness of four popular SBOM generators. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals all four SBOM generators exhibit inconsistent SBOMs and dependency omissions, leading to incomplete and potentially inaccurate SBOMs. Moreover, we construct a parser confusion attack against these tools, introducing a new attack vector to conceal malicious, vulnerable, or illegal packages within the software supply chain.

							"abstract": "Memory safety violations, such as buffer overflows, are the primary cause of security and reliability issues in software systems. Like the volatile main memory, byte-addressable persistent memory (PM) storage devices are also prone to memory safety exploits because PM devices are directly mapped to the address space and accessed via the load/store interface using pointers. However, the PM pointer representation is persistent, i.e., its offset and the associated object are persistent across system reboots. Therefore, the current memory safety mechanisms for the volatile main memory are inadequate for ensuring the safety of persistent pointers. To this end, we propose Safe Persistent Pointers (SPP), a practical memory safety approach against buffer overflows for PM applications. SPP augments persistent pointers with memory safety properties. SPP is based on a simple combination of tagged pointers, efficient persistent memory layout, and transactional updates to the memory safety metadata for ensuring crash consistency. SPP's efficient pointer representation does not require additional memory lookup operations at run-time while incurring minimal space overheads for storing the memory safety metadata. We implement SPP based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure accompanied by a runtime library and an adapted version of PM development kit (PMDK). Our evaluation demonstrates that SPP incurs low runtime and space overheads while preserving the crash-consistency property and maintaining the PMDK API intact, i.e., requiring no source code modifications.",

We describe how our findings could be leveraged to develop more powerful read disturbance attacks and more efficient defense mechanisms. We open source all our code and data to facilitate future research at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/HBM-Read-Disturbance.",

We extensively characterize 120 COTS DDR4 chips from two major manufacturers. We highlight four key results of our study. First, COTS DRAM chips are capable of 1) simultaneously activating up to 32 rows (i.e., simultaneous many-row activation), 2) executing a majority of X (MAJX) operation where X>3 (i.e., MAJ5, MAJ7, and MAJ9 operations), and 3) copying a DRAM row (concurrently) to up to 31 other DRAM rows, which we call Multi-RowCopy. Second, storing multiple copies of MAJX's input operands on all simultaneously activated rows drastically increases the success rate (i.e., the percentage of DRAM cells that correctly perform the computation) of the MAJX operation. For example, MAJ3 with 32-row activation (i.e., replicating each MAJ3's input operands 10 times) has a 30.81% higher average success rate than MAJ3 with 4-row activation (i.e., no replication). Third, data pattern affects the success rate of MAJX and Multi-RowCopy operations by 11.52% and 0.07% on average.

Mainstream OSes have, therefore, provided syscall interposition APIs for years, but these often incur prohibitive performance penalties in syscall-intensive applications. Recent work showed how to reduce this overhead by rewriting syscall instructions to invoke the interposer directly, avoiding expensive mode/context switches. However, these methods may not locate/rewrite all relevant instructions, which is essential for many applications. Our key insight is to combine the aforementioned techniques to efficiently intercept all system calls. We present lazypoline, a tool that uses slow kernel interfaces to exhaustively locate valid syscall instructions upon their first use, and then lazily rewrites them to invoke the interposer directly in all subsequent executions.

Mainstream OSes have, therefore, provided syscall interposition APIs for years, but these often incur prohibitive performance penalties in syscall-intensive applications. Recent work showed how to reduce this overhead by rewriting syscall instructions to invoke the interposer directly, avoiding expensive mode/context switches. However, these methods may not locate/rewrite all relevant instructions, which is essential for many applications. Our key insight is to combine the aforementioned techniques to efficiently intercept all system calls. We present lazypoline, a tool that uses slow kernel interfaces to exhaustively locate valid syscall instructions upon their first use, and then lazily rewrites them to invoke the interposer directly in all subsequent executions. We extensively evaluate lazypoline on micro- and macrobenchmarks and show that it is non-intrusive, fully exhaustive, and it achieves the efficiency of pure rewriting, even for datacenter-scale syscall-intensive workloads.",

In single-agent environments, these attacks can occur through imperceptible perturbations injected into the inputs of the victim policy network.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Intrinsically Motivated Adversarial Policy (IMAP) for efficient black-box adversarial policy learning in both single- and multi-agent environments. We formulate four types of adversarial intrinsic regularizers-maximizing the adversarial state coverage, policy coverage, risk, or divergence-to discover potential vulnerabilities of the victim policy in a principled way.

							"abstract": "Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) enables flexible and scalable 5G core deployment but it also introduces new attack vectors into the mobile network ecosystem, especially when network functions are deployed on public cloud infrastructure. To address this issue, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization body recommends isolating critical 5G core functionalities inside Hardware Mediated Execution Enclaves (HMEEs). However, the use of HMEEs can incur debilitating QoS degradation in control plane functions including Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol. In this paper, we design and implement network slices with HMEE-enforced isolation for sensitive AKA functions and characterize their performance. Our findings reveal that the use of HMEE leads to 1.2 to 1.5\u00D7 increase in function execution time and 2.2 to 2.9\u00D7 increase in response time for the isolated containers. While appearing very large, this overhead is a small fraction of the end-to-end session setup latency.

To address this issue, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization body recommends isolating critical 5G core functionalities inside Hardware Mediated Execution Enclaves (HMEEs). However, the use of HMEEs can incur debilitating QoS degradation in control plane functions including Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol. In this paper, we design and implement network slices with HMEE-enforced isolation for sensitive AKA functions and characterize their performance. Our findings reveal that the use of HMEE leads to 1.2 to 1.5\u00D7 increase in function execution time and 2.2 to 2.9\u00D7 increase in response time for the isolated containers. While appearing very large, this overhead is a small fraction of the end-to-end session setup latency. To evaluate the feasibility of HMEE, we use a real commercial User Equipment (UE) to register with the 5G core network through the isolated AKA functions. Finally, we discuss the role of HMEEs in addressing the key issues introduced by NFV.",

However, this increased usage has raised concerns about the safety and security of UAVs, emphasizing the critical role of their Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in ensuring accurate orientation and position data. IMU faults, including both Accelerometer faults and Gyrometer faults, can lead to severe consequences, such as mission failures, collisions, or loss of control. This study addresses the need to enhance UAV resilience in urban airspace by exploring the impact of various IMU faults. A comprehensive fault model is introduced in this paper, covering a range of faults from hardware malfunctions to external attacks. Through extensive fault injection experiments in a simulated environment, the study assesses the effects of different fault types and durations on mission outcomes, providing valuable insights for developing resilient and fault tolerant UAV systems. Evaluation metrics, including inner and outer bubble violations, missions completed, flight duration, and distance traveled, offer a comprehensive understanding of IMU fault impacts in dynamic operational scenarios. Results reveal that longer injection durations, particularly at 30 seconds, increase bubble violations and significantly reduce mission completion rates. Accelerometer faults, such as \"Accelerometer Freeze\" and \"Accelerometer Random\" exhibit reduced mission completion rates of 42.5% and 5%, respectively. Gyrometer faults, especially \"Gyrometer Minimum\" and \"Gyrometer Random\" lead to the lowest mission completion rates (2.5%). Additionally, IMU faults (where the fault affects both the Accelerometer and Gyrometer), notably \"IMU Minimum\", \"IMU Freeze\", and \"IMU Random\" result in complete mission failures, highlighting the importance of understanding specific fault characteristics. These insights can contribute to developing fault tolerance mechanisms and resilient UAV systems in complex and dynamic environments.",

When tracking the execution of CUDA applications, we design a hierarchical tracing scheme and extend the A-DCFG (Attributed Dynamic Control Flow Graph) to address the massively parallel execution in CUDA, ensuring Owl's detection scalability. After completing the initial assessment and filtering, we conduct statistical tests on the differences in program traces to determine whether they are indeed caused by input variations, subsequently facilitating the positioning of side-channel leaks. We evaluate Owl's capability to detect side-channel leaks by testing it on Libgpucrypto, PyTorch, and nvJPEG. Meanwhile, we verify that our solution effectively handles a large number of threads.

The focus is on the computing infrastructures, such as hyperscale cloud datacenters, that consume significant power, thus producing increasing amounts of carbon emissions. Our goal is to (1) optimize the usage of green energy sources (e.g., solar energy), which is desirable but expensive and relatively unstable, and (2) continuously reduce the use of fossil fuels, which have a lower cost but a significant negative societal impact. Meanwhile, cloud datacenters strive to meet their customers' requirements, e.g., service-level objectives (SLOs) in application latency or throughput, which are impacted by infrastructure resilience and availability. We propose a scalable formulation that combines sustainability, cloud resilience, and performance as a joint optimization problem with multiple interdependent objectives to address these issues holistically. Given the complexity and dynamicity of the problem, machine learning (ML) approaches, such as reinforcement learning, are essential for achieving continuous optimization. Our study highlights the challenges of green energy instability which necessitates innovative MLcentric solutions across heterogeneous infrastructures to manage the transition towards green computing. Underlying the MLcentric solutions must be methods to combine classic system resilience techniques with innovations in real-time ML resilience (not addressed heretofore).

							"abstract": "Safety-critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles, utilize machine learning (ML), where mispredictions could have disastrous consequences. Training data can contain faults, especially when collected through crowdsourcing. Ensembles, consisting of multiple ML models voting on predictions, have been found to be an effective resilience technique. Ensembles are resilient when their constituent models behave independently during inference, by focusing on different features in an input. However, independence is not observed on every input, resulting in mispredictions.

Training data can contain faults, especially when collected through crowdsourcing. Ensembles, consisting of multiple ML models voting on predictions, have been found to be an effective resilience technique. Ensembles are resilient when their constituent models behave independently during inference, by focusing on different features in an input. However, independence is not observed on every input, resulting in mispredictions. One way to improve ensemble resilience is to dynamically weigh predictions during inference by its constituent models instead of treating each model equally. While previous work on dynamically weighted models in ensembles has relied upon output diversity metrics due to efficiency, we focus on the feature-space of inputs for accuracy.

							"abstract": "Model training in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) requires federated unlearning under three scenarios: (1) vehicles want to erase their historical updates to protect their privacy,(2) servers eliminate the influence of dropout vehicles, and (3) servers recover the global model from the poisoning attack launched by malicious users. However, the existing federated unlearning methods based on retraining, such as FedRecover[1] and FedErase[2], cannot be applied directly to the IoV scenarios. Firstly, in these schemes, the server needs to store all the local gradients uploaded by clients, resulting in significant storage space occupation. Secondly, their methods assume that all clients engaged in Federated learning (FL) from the beginning and will not exit, which does not align with the characteristics of FL in IoV where vehicles can join and leave FL at any time. To address these challenges, we propose a federated unlearning scheme suitable for IoV scenarios. We use a backtracking mechanism to achieve unlearning instead of re-initializing like other approaches. Then, we build our function over Cauchy mean value theorem to recover the performance of the global model. To reduce the storage burden of the server, we present a novel method that only saves the direction of the local updates, which can spare approximately 95% of the storing overhead. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of our scheme that uses just the direction of historical gradients and historical models. Therefore, our work enables federated unlearning to be applied in practical applications in the IoV.",

We explore information leakage stemming from a known DNSSEC vulnerability that facilitates a process known as zone walking, which enables the efficient collection of all FQDNs. This paper is divided into two main sections. First, we show that the information leaked by zone walking is sometimes private and should be protected. We demonstrate this by identifying instances where private information is disclosed through zone-walking, emphasizing that zone walking is an effective replacement for network scanning in IPv6 networks, and that FQDNs often constitute de facto private information. This last point is addressed by comparing data collected from DomainTools' passive DNS database with data collected from zone walking. We found that more than 50% of FQDNs found from zone walking are not in the passive DNS dataset. This indicates that these FQDNs are not used publicly, despite being accessible on publicly available DNS servers. In the second part of this paper, we propose and test a novel and practical approach - Zone-Hopping (ZH) to mitigate this information leakage issue, all the while preserving the integrity of the DNS/DNSSEC protocol.

These vehicles use object detection algorithms to sense and interpret their environment, enabling them to navigate and make decisions autonomously. Therefore, object detection systems are essential to ensure the effectiveness and safety of AV operations. However, recent studies have shown that object detection systems based on deep neural networks are susceptible to interference from intentionally designed objects containing adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we investigate the dependability of AVs by designing physical adversarial patches (APs) to fool object detectors. To ensure that the APs work in the real-world AVs, our APs have the following designs. First, we use the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) technique to make APs adaptive to environmental challenges such as distance, angle, and shadow. Instead of using colored APs, our APs are monochrome and their shapes are more controllable, making them more stealthy on the road. Most importantly, an object is confirmed by AVs only after the object is detected for consecutive frames; however, most existing APs can only work in static cases. Our APs overcome the above challenges and ensure attack success in dynamic cases. Our experimental results show that our AP can effectively attack YOLOv3-tiny.",

However, current evaluations of these algorithms often overlook how heterogeneous network latencies impact system performance. In this work, we first explore the influence of heterogeneous latencies as found in planetary-scale networks towards tree-based BFT protocol performance. Subsequently, we propose an optimization method which searches for an optimal communication tree by adapting tree configurations to given network conditions, thus minimizing system latency.

							"abstract": "Neural networks have proven to be extremely effective at tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, their security and robustness are controversial. Even state-of-the-art object detectors can be fooled by localized patch attacks, which might lead to safety-critical incidents. In these attacks, adversaries place a subtle adversarial patch in an image, causing detectors to either miss real objects or detect phantom objects. These adversarial patches often force state-of-the-art detectors to make highly confident but incorrect predictions. The practical implications of these attacks in real-world settings further increase the concern. This paper presents a unique method for detecting real-world adversarial patches using entropy-sensitive depth estimation. Therefore, we take advantage of the fact that adversarial patches typically introduce high local entropy and are located in front of an object. We have fine-tuned a monocular depth estimation neural network to exploit these two features to extract adversarial patches from an image. Using this approach, we are able to achieve a true positive detection rate of 77.5% on the APRICOT test set.",

							"abstract": "A deep learning model may be poisoned and still perform as expected when receiving a clean input but will misclassify when receiving a backdoored input. This is similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAP). Indeed, UAPs are input-agnostic perturbations capable of misleading a well-trained model. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations than UAPs from clean models for a successful attack. UAPs from backdoored models tend to exploit the shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor.

This is similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAP). Indeed, UAPs are input-agnostic perturbations capable of misleading a well-trained model. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations than UAPs from clean models for a successful attack. UAPs from backdoored models tend to exploit the shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor. Based on this finding, we propose a backdoor detection method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor Detection (USB). With it, we can reverse engineer potential backdoor triggers via UAPs.

As such, many sanitizers have been proposed to enhance memory safety at the development or deployment phase. However, existing solutions still face many practical challenges, including significant performance overhead, low compatibility with legacy code, and non-comprehensive protection for various program objects and sub-objects. In this paper, we propose CECSan, an integrated highly Compatible, Efficient and Comprehensive compiler-based Sanitizer to detect spatial and temporal memory errors in C/C++ programs. CECSan enforces full memory safety using a integration of pointer tagging, compact metadata table, compiler instrumentation and optimization. The pointer tagging encodes an object metadata index within pointer itself, while instrumentation adds metadata retrival and safety checks for all memory accesses. Specifically, CECSan has advantages over previous sanitizers by simultaneously: 1) supporting memory safety guarantee on sub-object granularity; 2) significantly reducing performance overhead with various optimization strategies; 3) removing the need of a customized memory allocator and avoiding object memory layout changes to improve compatibility. Evaluations on our prototype show that, CECSan outperforms known sanitizers by achieving a bug detection rate of 100% on the Juliet Test Suite. Additionally, CECSan significantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining an acceptable level of runtime overhead.",
