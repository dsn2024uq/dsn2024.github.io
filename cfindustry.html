    <h1><b>DSN-2022: Industry Track Call For Contributions</b></h1>

    <p>The extensive reliance on computing systems and networks raises numerous
    dependability challenges. Researchers and practitioners face complex
    interdisciplinary issues, from manufacturing technology to hardware and
    software development, networking, integration of complex systems, and
    cyber-security. The DSN-2022 Industry track provides a forum for
    interaction between industry and academia, and presentation of the latest
    R&D and operational challenges, practical solutions, case studies, and
    field dependability data.</p>

    <p>Industry contributions to the DSN community are invited to address
    dependability issues related to either the development process or the
    operation of critical systems as seen from an industrial perspective.</p>

    <p>The topics of interest target several aspects of dependable systems and
    networks:
    <ul>
    <li>Hardware (e.g., VLSI, FPGA, and SOC)
    <li>Technology (e.g., FinFET, nanotechnology, soft errors, and obsolescence
    of HW components)
    <li>Networks (e.g., networks on a chip, optical networks, and wireless networks)
    <li>Software (e.g., applications, middleware, and operating systems)
    <li>Security (e.g., hardware and software cyber-security, and network security)
    <li>Safety (e.g., autonomous critical systems/objects, car-to-X, plane-to-X systems)
    <li>Field data (e.g. hardware and software fault/error data)
    <li>Applications (e.g., embedded systems, drive by wire, and autonomous vehicles)
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The Industry Track aims in particular at promoting and fostering
    discussion on advanced current work in an industrial context, feedback from
    experiments, scalability issues regarding recent techniques, novel
    technology-related problems, etc.</p>

    <p>The objective of this track is not to compete with the main DSN track,
    where finalized research and development work is presented, but to give the
    members of industrial and academic communities the opportunity to discuss
    hot topics regarding the future of dependable systems and networks, and to
    share experience among different industrial domains:
    <ul>
    <li>Dependability Issues in Software Defined Data Centers
    <li>Dependability of Cyber-physical Systems and Internet of Things
    <li>Safety and Security of Intelligent Vehicles
    <li>Dependability Assessment of Complex Systems
    <li>Dependability, Privacy, and Security of Clouds
    <li>Dependability of Data Centers and Virtual Machines
    <li>Dependability and Security of System Operation
    <li>Fault-tolerance for Extreme Scale Systems
    <li>Trustworthiness of Smart Grids
    <li>Dependability and Security of Big Data Systems
    <li>Dependability of Blockchain and Financial Technology (Fintech) Systems
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Important dates:</b></h2>
    <p>Abstract Submission Deadline: March 21, 2022</p>
    <p>Paper Submission Deadline: <s>March 21, 2022</s> March 28, 2022</p>
    <p>Notification: April 20, 2022</p>
    <p>Camera Ready Materials: May 4, 2022</p>

    <h2><b>Submission Guidelines:</b></h2>

    <p>We solicit contributions in one of three formats:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Position papers</b> can focus on specific dependability aspects in
    practice, either a product or service offered to the market or
    dependability analysis tools.
    <li><b>Short papers</b> should emphasize dependability challenges,
    practical solutions, tradeoffs, strengths and weaknesses of adopted
    solutions, lessons learned, and field and/or measured data.
    <li><b>Posters</b> should address dependability aspects of either a product
    or service offered to the market or in advance stages of development.
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>All materials must be written in English, 1 page for position papers, or
    2 to 4 pages for short papers (IEEE double-column format). Papers must be
    submitted in their final form. For poster submissions, an abstract
    summarizing the poster content (750 words â€“ free format) must be submitted.
    A Poster template will be available for the selected abstracts. Posters
    will be exhibited in the conference according to the agenda.</p>

    <p><b>Contributions must be in PDF and submitted through the DSN2022
    Industry Track's submission website: <a
    href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dsn2022industrytrack">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dsn2022industrytrack</a>.</b></p>

    <p>Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process.</p>

    <p>All accepted papers/abstracts will be published in the DSN supplemental
    volume and made available in IEEE Xplore. Accepted materials will be
    presented in dedicated sessions.</p>
