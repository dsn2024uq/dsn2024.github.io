    <h1><b>Call for Workshops</b></h1>
    <p class="rtejustify"> The workshops at DSN'2024 aim to provide a forum where researchers can gather and engage in discussions about various aspects of dependability-related research and its practical applications. These workshops cover a wide range of topics, serving
      as incubators for specific scientific communities with shared research goals. They also offer a valuable opportunity for researchers to exchange and explore scientific ideas in their early stages, well before reaching the level of maturity required for conference or journal publication.
  </p>

  <p>Accepted workshops will have a two-page proceedings-format summary (generated by the workshop organizers) published in the Main Proceedings of the conference. Written contributions to the workshop itself (summaries, short papers, etc.) will
      be included in the supplement to the DSN Proceedings (DSN-W volume) and made available on IEEE Xplore. The workshop web pages will be linked through the main DSN website (www.dsn.org) and the call for papers will be advertised through
      the DSN mailing lists.</p>

  <p>Organizers are expected to perform any additional advertising in related communities outside the main DSN community, to create and maintain the workshop website, arrange for the collection and refereeing of submissions, and to co-ordinate
      the collection and delivery of camera ready material and IEEE copyright transfers.</p>

  <p>Please submit all workshop proposals by January 15, 2024, preferably as a PDF file, via e-mail to <a href="mailto:workshops@dsn.org" target="_blank">workshops@dsn.org</a>.</p>

  <p>Workshop proposers will be notified of the outcome of their submission by January 25, 2024. The timelines for submissions to the accepted workshops will be communicated directly to the proposers.</p>

    <h1><b>DSN-2024: Workshops</b></h1>

    <p>The workshops at the DSN 2024 provide a forum for groups of researchers
    to discuss topics in dependability-related research and practice. DSN
    workshops can be quite diverse. They serve as incubators for scientific
    communities that form and share a particular research agenda. They also
    provide opportunities for researchers to exchange and discuss scientific
    ideas at an early stage, before they have matured to warrant conference or
    journal publication.</p>

      <p>The list of workshops will be coming soon.</p>

    <h2><b>Workshop on Data-Centric Dependability and Security (DCDS)</b></h2>
    <p><b>Website:</b> <a
    href="http://dcds.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt">http://dcds.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/</a></p>

    <p><b>Description:</b></p>

    <p>The workshop aims at providing researchers with a forum to exchange and
    discuss scientific contributions and open challenges, both theoretical and
    practical, related to the use of data-centric approaches that promote the
    dependability and cybersecurity of computing systems. We want to foster
    joint work and knowledge exchange between the dependability and security
    communities, and researchers and practitioners from areas such as machine
    and statistical learning, and data science and visualization. The workshop
    provides a forum for discussing novel trends in data-centric processing
    technologies and the role of such technologies in the development of
    resilient systems. It aims to discuss novel approaches for processing and
    analyzing data generated by the systems as well as information gathered
    from open sources, leveraging from data science, machine and statistical
    learning techniques, and visualization. The workshop shall contribute to
    identify new application areas as well as open and future research
    problems, for data-centric approaches to system dependability and security.</p>

    <h2><b>Workshop on Artificial Intelligence To Security</b></h2>
    <p><b>Website:</b> <a
    href="https://aits2022.github.io/">https://aits2022.github.io/</a></p>

    <p><b>Description:</b></p>

    <p>With the development of the Internet, cyber security becomes more and
    more important. Facing increasing cyber-attacks, the traditional methods to
    protect information systems are becoming lagging and powerless.
    Fortunately, artificial intelligent technology offers a completely new and
    challenging opportunity to the security practitioners. The aim of Internet
    Workshop on Artificial Intelligence To Security (AITS 2022) is to provide a
    platform to the researchers and practitioners from both academia as well as
    industry to meet and share knowledge and results in theory, methodology and
    applications in cyberspace security by artificial intelligent
    technology.</p>

    <h2><b>Workshop on Dependable and Secure Machine Learning (DSML)</b></h2>
    <p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://dependablesecureml.github.io/index.html">https://dependablesecureml.github.io/index.html</a></p>

    <p><b>Description:</b></p>

    <p>Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in critical domains such as
    health and wellness, criminal sentencing recommendations, commerce,
    transportation, human capital management, entertainment, and communication.
    The design of ML systems has mainly focused on developing models,
    algorithms, and datasets on which they are trained to demonstrate high
    accuracy for specific tasks such as object recognition and classification.
    Machine learning algorithms typically construct a model by training on a
    labeled training dataset and their performance is assessed based on the
    accuracy in predicting labels for unseen (but often similar) testing data.
    This is based on the assumption that the training dataset is representative
    of the inputs that the system will face in deployment. However, in practice
    there are a wide variety of unexpected accidental, as well as
    adversarially-crafted, perturbations on the ML inputs that might lead to
    violations of this assumption. ML algorithms are also often over-confident
    about their predictions when processing such unexpected inputs. This makes
    it difficult to deploy them in safety critical settings where one needs to
    be able to rely on the ML predictions to make decisions or revert back to a
    failsafe mode. Further, ML algorithms are often executed on special-purpose
    hardware accelerators, which may themselves be subject to faults. Thus,
    there is a growing concern regarding the reliability, safety, security, and
    accountability of machine learning systems.</p>

    <p>The DSN Workshop on Dependable and Secure Machine Learning (DSML) is an
    open forum for researchers, practitioners, and regulatory experts, to
    present and discuss innovative ideas and practical techniques and tools for
    producing dependable and secure ML systems. A major goal of the workshop is
    to draw the attention of the research community to the problem of
    establishing guarantees of reliability, security, safety, and robustness
    for systems that incorporate increasingly complex ML models, and to the
    challenge of determining whether such systems can comply with requirements
    for safety-critical systems. A further goal is to build a research
    community at the intersection of machine learning and dependable and secure
    computing.</p>

    <p><b>Important dates:</b></p>

    <li>Workshop submission: March 28 (AoE) 
    <li>Workshop notification: April 18 
    <li>Workshop Camera-ready: May 2

    <h2><b>Workshop on Safety and Security in Intelligent Vehicles (SSIV)</b></h2>
    <p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ssiv">https://sites.google.com/view/ssiv</a></p>

    <p><b>Description:</b></p>

    <p>This will be the eighth edition of the SSIV workshop, aimed at
    continuing the success of previous editions. The vast range of open
    challenges to achieve Safety and Security in Intelligent Vehicles (with or
    without connection with the Internet) is a fundamental reason that
    justifies the numerous research initiatives and wide discussion on these
    matters, which we are currently observing everywhere.</p>

    <p>The successful pairing of man and machine, represented by robotics
    solutions that augment humans, has the potential to make our workforce
    safer and more productive and provide a non-conventional way of
    transportation. Therefore, the workshop will keep its focus on exploring
    the challenges and interdependencies between security, real-time, safety
    and certification, which emerge when introducing networked, autonomous and
    cooperative functionalities.</p>
