                Space in a blockchain is a scarce resource. Cryptocurrencies
                today use auctions to decide which transactions get confirmed
                in the block. Intriguingly, classical auctions fail in such a
                decentralized environment, since even the auctioneer can be a
                strategic player. For example, the second-price auction is a
                golden standard in classical mechanism design. It fails,
                however, in the blockchain environment since the miner can
                easily inject a bid that is epsilon smaller than the k-th price
                where k is the block size. Moreover, the miner and users can
                also collude through the smart contract mechanisms available in
                modern cryptocurrencies.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">
                I will talk about a new foundation for mechanism design in a decentralized
                environment. I will prove an impossibility result which rules out the existence
                of a dream transaction fee mechanism that incentivizes honest behavior for the
                user, the miner, and a miner-user coalition at the same time. I will then argue
                why the prior modeling choices are too draconian, and how we can overcome this
                lower bound by capturing hidden costs pertaining to certain deviations.

                Machine learning has seen incredible progress over the past few
                years, and problems once seen as science fiction are now nearly
                trivial. However current machine learning systems lack one
                important property: dependability. In this talk I examine the
                (lack of) dependability in modern machine learning techniques
                when evaluated in adversarial environments. And if we continue
                in the current direction, I argue future machine learning
                systems will be less reliable in the future.

                Exascale scientific computing is a fierce international
                competition that started circa 2007. Since that time and for
                about 15 years, the research on resilience and fault tolerance
                for exascale computing has explored many territories, including
                the characterization of faults, errors, and failures in large
                HPC systems and a wide variety of mitigation methods. We will
                review the main results of this intense analysis and
                exploration period, which produced the foundations for the
                solutions that will be used on the exascale systems in the
                United States. However, the community now is facing an
                important new problem: Many numerical simulations will generate
                a huge flow of data that is too large to store, communicate,
                and analyze completely. Data reduction and, in particular,
                lossy reduction and compression of scientific data become a
                necessity. Because lossy data reduction removes information, it
                may directly affect numerical simulation correctness and thus
                the dependability of results. A critical question thus arises:
                How can we reduce scientific data by one or more orders of
                magnitude while keeping the same science and the same
                predictions? We will discuss this important new trend and the
                new results concerning scientific data reduction methods and
                methods to assess the correctness of results produced from
                lossy-reduced scientific data.

                Franck Cappello is senior computer scientist and R&D lead at
                Argonne National laboratory. Franck started working on fault
                tolerance for high performance scientific computing more than
                20 year ago. With his students and collaborators, he explored
                many different and complementary aspects of resilience and
                fault tolerance for scientific computing at extreme scale:
                fault/error/failure characterization, checkpointing, fault
                tolerance protocols, optimal checkpoint scheduling, silent data
                corruption detection and mitigation, failure prediction
                producing about 100 international publications on this domain.
                He led the resilience topic of the International Exascale
                Software Project and the European Exascale Software Initiative
                that identified critical challenges of exascale computing in US
                and Europe. Franck leads the VeloC innovative asynchronous
                multi-level checkpointing project funded by the U.S. Exascale
                Computing Project (ECP) that will serve applications running on
                the US exascale systems. From 2016 and with the support of ECP,
                he started exploring lossy compression for scientific computing
                to address the increasing discrepancy between scientific
                application data set sizes and the capacities of HPC storage
                infrastructures. This research produced the SZ lossy compressor
                and Z-checker tool to assess the nature of lossy compression
                errors. Franck is IEEE fellow and recipient of two prestigious
                R&D100 awards, the 2018 IEEE TCPP Outstanding Service Award and
                the 2021 IEEE Transactions in Computers Award for Editorial
                Service and Excellence.
