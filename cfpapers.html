    <h1><b>DSN-2022: Research Track Call For Contributions</b></h1>

    <p>The society today is increasingly dependent on the correct functioning
    of computer systems, edge devices and networks for systems and services we
    use every day, such as aviation, energy production & power grids,
    intelligent/autonomous vehicles, medical devices & electronic health
    records, and many others.</p>

    <p>The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and
    Networks (DSN) is devoted to the mission of ensuring that the computing
    systems and networks on which society relies are dependable and secure.</p>

    <p>DSN, one of the longest running IEEE conferences organizing its 52nd
    edition in 2022, has pioneered the fusion between dependability and
    security research under a common body of knowledge, understanding the need
    to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional
    cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. Its
    distinctive approach to both accidental faults and malicious attacks made
    DSN the most prestigious international forum for presenting research
    furthering robustness and resilience of today’s wide spectrum of computing
    systems and networks.</p>

    <p>All aspects of the research and practice of dependability and applied
    security are within the scope of DSN. Relevant topics include innovative
    architectures, protocols, and algorithms, for preventing, detecting,
    recovering, diagnosing or eliminating accidental and malicious threats as
    well as experimentation with and assessment of dependable and secure
    systems and networks.</p>

    <p>Authors are invited to submit original papers on the  current thematic areas of DSN:
    <ul>
    <li>Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, memories, system on chip, I/O devices,
    storage systems,Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs))

    <li>Software (e.g., applications, middleware, distributed algorithms,
    operating systems, software security)
 
    <li>Networked systems and clouds (e.g., wireless networks, mobility,
    software-defined networking, edge computing, cloud computing/storage,
    networks on chip, network security)

    <li>Autonomous systems (e.g, self-driving vehicles, autonomous  robots,
    assured autonomy, explainable decision making, acceptability)

    <li>Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, real-time control of
    critical systems, internet of things, smart  grid, automotive, aerospace,
    railway, medical systems)

    <li>Distributed ledgers/Blockchain (e.g., BFT/consensus algorithms,
    cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage, zero knowledge proofs,...)

    <li>AI/Machine Learning for resilient systems (e.g., resilient, secure, and
    explainable AI/Machine Learning techniques; applications of AI/ML
    techniques for dependability and security)

    <li>Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and
    assessing dependable and secure  systems (e.g., performance and
    dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation,
    experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis)
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h2><b>Important dates:</b></h2>
    <p>Dec. 3, 2021: Abstract submission deadline</p>
    <p>Dec. 10, 2021:  Paper submission deadline</p>
    <p>Jan. 26, 2022:  Early reject notification</p>
    <p>Feb. 21 - 23, 2022: Author rebuttal period</p>
    <p>Mar. 14, 2022: Notification to authors</p>
    <p><b>* All dates refer to AoE time (Anywhere on Earth) *</b></p>


    <h2><b>Information to authors:</b></h2>
    <p>Innovative papers in other areas of dependable and secure systems and
    networks will also be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria
    appropriate to each category. The conference favors work that explores new
    territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on
    experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art implementations.
    Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, correctness and
    impact.</p>

    <p>Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions
    will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2022, if
    accepted.</p>

    <p>All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will
    publish accepted contributions.</p>

    <p>At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as
    a regular registration) for the conference and present the work.</p>


    <h2><b>Paper Categories:</b></h2>
    <p>Submissions can be made in one of the following categories (authors are
    required to indicate the category as part of the paper’s title).</p>

    <p><b><u>Regular papers (11 pages)</u></b>: full paper describing research
    contribution, including experimental work focused on implementation and
    evaluation of existing techniques in the DSN thematic areas. Papers should
    clearly describe a novel scientific contribution and a significant
    advancement of the state of knowledge in DSN relevant topics. The paper
    should address a significant problem with a compelling solution whose
    validity and practical applicability are clearly discussed.</p>

    <p><b><u>Practical experience reports (7 pages)</u></b>: a shorter paper
    describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and
    techniques to real-world problems and systems, or based on the empirical
    analysis of field data using a rigorous scientific approach. A paper on
    this category is expected to show new insights and experiences informing
    the research and practice of dependability and resilient computing.
    Contributions reporting on industry practical experiences and lessons
    learned are highly encouraged, including studies reporting negative results
    or challenges about the practical applicability or scalability of research
    results in industry.</p>

    <p><b><u>Tool descriptions/demonstrations (7 pages)</u></b>: descriptions of the
    architecture, implementation and usage of substantive tools to aid the
    research and practice of dependability. A tool paper is expected to
    describe and demonstrate the value that the tool brings to the
    dependability community. Making the tool publicly available, whenever
    possible, is strongly encouraged.</p>

    <p><b>The number of pages indicated above includes everything except the
    references: title page, text, figures, appendices</b>, etc. Papers that
    exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be <u>rejected
    without review</u>.

    <p>Independently of the paper category, we expect all papers to provide
    enough detail to enable reproducibility of their experimental results and
    encourage authors, whenever possible, to make both the software developed
    in the experiments or datasets publicly available.<p>

    <h2><b>Anonymization Rules:</b></h2>
    <p>Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their paper. As an
    author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or
    by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However,
    only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names
    may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer
    to be able to evaluate the work. For example, a paper on experiences with
    the design of .NET should not be re-written to be about "an anonymous but
    widely used commercial distributed systems platform."</p>

    <p>Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:
    <ul>
    <li>Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page.
 
    <li>Remove acknowledgement of identifying names and funding sources.
 
    <li>Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi,
    are often embedded in the final output as  readily accessible comments.
 
    <li>Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not
    omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to
    grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work
    in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work.
 
    <li>If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: “Closely
    related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2021].” with
    the corresponding citation: “[Anonymous 2021] Under submission. Details
    omitted for double-blind reviewing.” This is, for example, the case for
    extended versions of the paper available online.

    <li>If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized
    reference(s) to the PC chair in a separate email.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Authors should also avoid broadly advertising their work in a way that
    reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it (for example,
    presentations in small meetings or seminars are appropriate). It is
    unacceptable to discuss the work with program committee members or post the
    work on ArXiV or a similar site just before or while the paper is under
    evaluation in DSN.</p>

    <p>Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline,
    anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or
    line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously
    published, or under submission to multiple venues, <u>will be
    disregarded</u>.</b>

    <p><b>Formatting Rules:</b></p>
    <p>Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society camera-ready
    8.5″x11″ two-column camera-ready format (using a 10-point font on 12-point
    single-spaced leading) as implemented by the LaTeX/Word templates available
    at the <a
    href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE
    conference template</a> page (last updated in 2019):</p>

    <p>LaTex Package (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/conference-latex-template_10-17-19.zip">ZIP</a>)</p>
    <p>Word Template (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-letter.docx">DOC</a>)</p>

    <p>Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF)
    file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend you print the
    file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before
    submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance
    of success. Please take a note of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Submissions should be anonymous.
    <li>The page limit includes everything except references.
    <li>The first page must include the title of the paper, the type of the
        paper (Regular / Practical Experience / Tool), and a maximum 150-word
        abstract.
    <li>Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the
        reviewers to bid on papers: describe the paper goals clearly, as well
        as the means used to achieve them.
    <li>The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (and
        thus has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the
        total page budget for the paper.
    <li>There is no page limit for references - however, authors must not put
        any text or figures on the pages for the references - if so, those
        pages will be included in the page limits above (it is acceptable for
        the references to start on the last page of the paper as long as it is
        within the page limit).
    <li>Pages should be numbered.
    <li>The use of color for figures and graphs is encouraged, but the paper
        should be easily readable if printed in grayscale.
    <li>Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed,
        without requiring on-screen magnification.
    <li>Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Paper Submissions:</b></h2>
    <p>Papers are submitted via the submission website: <a
    href="https://dsn2022.hotcrp.com/">https://dsn2022.hotcrp.com/</a>.</p>

    <p>The program committee will perform double-blind reviewing of all
    submissions, with limited use of outside referees. Papers will be held in
    full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by
    nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected
    without review.</p>

    <p>Authors must anonymize their submissions (see Anonymization Rules).
    Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be
    rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.</p>

    <h2><b>Awards:</b></h2>
    <p>DSN attributes a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted scientific
    papers. The selection of the candidate papers for the award is carried out
    first by the Program Committee that picks up to six of the accepted papers;
    then, the Steering Committee chooses among these six papers the three
    candidate papers to be presented in a special session at the conference;
    finally, the audience at the conference votes for the paper that should
    receive the award.</p>

    <p>DSN also attributes a group of awards based on nominations. These awards
    are the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability, the
    Rising Star in Dependability Award, the Test-of-Time Award, and the
    Jean-Claude Laprie Award. Please check the relevant page on the DSN website
    for additional details.</p>

    <h2><b>Review Process and Author Response:</b></h2>

    <p>Note: We would like to inform authors that this year, DSN will adopt an
    <u>Early Rejection Notification Policy</u>. To save authors time, we
    decided that the papers that receive three rejection scores in the first
    round will be notified at the end of the latter instead of remaining stuck
    in the system until the overall reviewing process is over. As such, authors
    may get started earlier on improving their manuscript for a future
    submission.</p>

    <p>Authors who do not receive early rejection will have the opportunity to
    correct, during the rebuttal period, factual inaccuracies in the reviews.
    After the papers have been reviewed, but prior to the Program Committee
    meeting, the reviews will be made available to the authors to provide a
    forum for responding to any factual errors in the reviews. Please note that
    this is NOT a forum to add any additional information on the paper, to
    submit an updated or revised paper, or to list changes the authors promise
    to include in the final version. Author responses will be made available to
    all PC members before the paper is discussed for selection in the PC
    meeting.</p>

    <p>All accepted papers will be subject to the revision and approval of a PC
    member acting as shepherd.</p>

    <h2><b>Open Science Policy</b></h2>
    <p>After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all
    research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that
    empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports
    the adoption of open source and open data principles, and encourages all
    authors to make their prototypes available to the dependability community
    and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability.
    Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or
    acceptance.</p>

    <h2><b>Ethical considerations:</b></h2>
    <p>Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects
    or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss
    how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an
    ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics
    review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially
    high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have
    taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the
    vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with
    personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g. by
    following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s
    review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it
    examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right
    to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that
    significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately
    addressed.</p>

    <p>Contact the program co-chairs <span
    style="color:blue">pc_chairs@dsn.org</span> if you have any questions.</p>

    <h2><b>Conflicts of Interest:</b></h2>
    <p>Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during
    the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of
    interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone
    who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of
    submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the
    last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or
    (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms
    of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived
    conflict to the PC chairs.</p>

    <p>Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper,
    including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion
    concerning the paper.</p>

    <h2><b>Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members:</b></h2>
    <p>To avoid potential bias, the DSN Program Committee Co-Chairs are not
    allowed to (co-)author any submission to the conference. There are no such
    restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members
    including the General chairs since double blind anonymization rules and
    conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We
    should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the
    processes related to the technical program including the selection of the
    PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing and acceptance of
    papers.</p>
