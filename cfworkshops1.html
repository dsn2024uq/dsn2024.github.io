    <h1><b>DSN-2022: Call for Workshops</b></h1>

    <p>The workshops at the DSN 2022 provide a forum for groups of researchers
    to discuss topics in dependability-related research and practice. DSN
    workshops can be quite diverse. They serve as incubators for scientific
    communities that form and share a particular research agenda. They also
    provide opportunities for researchers to exchange and discuss scientific
    ideas at an early stage, before they have matured to warrant conference or
    journal publication.</p>

    <h2><b>Topics of Interest</b></h2>
    <p>DSN is interested in workshop topics that represent either complementary
    areas to the main conference or a large, active subarea. Topics from recent
    DSN workshops include (alphabetical order):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Adaptive and Mobile Unbiquitous System Dependability
    <li>Analysis of Reliability and Security Data
    <li>Blockchains
    <li>Dependability of Clouds, Data Centers, Virtual Machines and Containers
    <li>Cyber-physical Systems Dependability
    <li>Dependability Assessment of Complex Systems
    <li>Dependable and Secure Nano Computing
    <li>Dependability and Security of System Operation
    <li>Dependability Issues in AI Systems
    <li>Dependability Issues in Software Defined Networks
    <li>Distributed ledgers
    <li>Fault Tolerance for Extreme Scale Systems
    <li>Infrastructures for Machine Learning and Data Engineering
    <li>Resilient Computing
    <li>Safety and Security of Intelligent Vehicles
    <li>Sensor Networks Dependability
    <li>Trustworthiness of Smart Grids
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Important dates:</b></h2>
    <p>Workshop proposal submission deadline: <del>28.Nov.2021</del> 12.Dec.2021</p>
    <p>Notifications to workshop proposers: <del>12.Dec.2021</del> 08.Jan.2022</p>
    <p>Workshop day of DSN 2022: 27.June.2022</p>


    <h2><b>Format of Proposals:</b></h2>
    <p>A workshop proposal consists of a descriptive proposal that is not more
    than 4 pages in length and contains the following information:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Title and description of the workshop including motivations, goals, and
    relevance to the dependability community.
    <li>Names and contact information of the organizers, including a brief statement on their background and past workshop experience.
    <li>A description of the workshop planning processes, including the invitation and selection of participants, the refereeing of papers, a tentative program committee if available, and any other pre-workshop activities.
    <li>A summary of the planned workshop activities including length of time (full day or half day), space required (i.e., room capacity), and the expected workshop outputs. A desired schedule, i.e., approximate number of papers, invited talks, panels, and/or discussion sessions.
    <li>Whether the workshop is new or an ongoing workshop. Information on past editions of the workshop (if applicable) including:
        <ul>
        <li>History and frequency of the workshop
        <li>Previous conference co-locations
        <li>URLs, if available
        <li>Approximate attendance (for each past edition)
        <li>How papers were published (website, IEEE, ACM, etc.).
        </ul>
    <li>Communities from which participation is expected.
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Acceptance and Publication:</b></h2>

    <p>Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the workshop’s potential
    for generating useful results, the timeliness of and expected interest in
    the topic, and the proposers’ ability to lead a successful workshop.</p>

    <p>Accepted workshops will have a two-page proceedings-format summary
    (generated by the workshop organizers) published in the Main Proceedings of
    the conference. Written contributions to the workshop itself (summaries,
    short papers, etc.) will be included in the supplement to the DSN
    Proceedings  (DSN-W volume) and made available on IEEE Xplore. The workshop
    web pages will be linked through the main DSN website (<a
    href="https://www.dsn.org">www.dsn.org</a>) and the call for papers will be
    advertised through the DSN mailing lists.</p>

    <p>Organizers are expected to perform any additional advertising in related
    communities outside the main DSN community, to create and maintain the
    workshop website, arrange for the collection and refereeing of submissions,
    and to coordinate the collection and delivery of camera ready material and
    IEEE copyright transfers.</p>

    <p>Please submit all workshop proposals by <b>Dec. 12, 2021</b>, preferably
    as a PDF file, via e-mail to <b>workshops@dsn.org</b>.</p>

    <p>Workshop proposers will be notified of the outcome of their submission
    by Jan. 8, 2022. The timelines for submissions to the accepted workshops
    will be communicated directly to the proposers.</p>

    <h2><b>Workshop Chairs:</b></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Ibéria Medeiros, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
    <li>HariGovind (Hari) Ramasamy, Amazon, USA
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Contacts:</b></h2>
